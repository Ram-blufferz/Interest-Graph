INTEREST GRAPH:	
		Interest Graph is an application that lets you know how you have interacted with fb.

		You do random activities on fb. But these random activities form a pattern and these pattern form your image in fb and thats the image 			that is seen as you by your fb friends.

		The image can be "Sportsy dude" , "geeky guy" , "gadget freak" , "political mind" , "book worm" and list goes on.

		So what we do is let you know what kind of a image you have created.
	
		It gives you a graph showing the categories that you have concentrated more in fb.
